## Description

I was given the assignment through Triliogy/WASHU Coding Bootcamp to "architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL". The user story was that, "As a business owner I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company So that I can organize and plan my business".  I have used the American version of "The Office" as my source of ```seed.sql``` data.
